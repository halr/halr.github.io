I am Hal Rodriguez and I am one half of the Tech Couture design studio [Amped Atelier](https://www.ampedatelier.com). We wrote the book [***Make It Wear It**: Wearable Electronics for Makers, Crafters, and Cosplayers*](https://www.makeitwearitbook.com). Now I am back at NYU's ITP to finish my masters.
