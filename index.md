I am back at NYU's ITP to finish my masters. This blog documents my assigments, experiments, explorations, and projects. My classes for the Spring 2021 semester are:
* [MIxD](mixd.md) — Music Interaction Design
* [Intangible Interaction](intangible.md) — production assignments
* [Big LEDs](bigleds.md) — LEDs are awesome!
