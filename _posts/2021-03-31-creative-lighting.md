[Entwined by Charles Gadeken](https://www.charlesgadeken.com/entwined) is an inspiring large scale LED based sculpture installation currently at [Golden Gate Park](https://www.goldengatepark150.com/entwined) in San Francisco. It is a set of metal sculptures composed of three trees and at least 16 shrubs.

An interesting aspect of Entwined is the interactivity provided on site. Most, if not all, of the waist high shrubs have a barcode on them that [links to a web app](https://entwined.charliestigler.com/shrubs/18?key=26881c3ebd2498fa9d42fc6d474f47af) that lets you control the lights on the shrub for a short period of time.

Additionally, t is also possible to create custom patterns and animations for Entwined using an older version of [LX Studio](http://lx.studio), a performance and development environment built using [Processing](https://processing.org). LX Studio contains a three dimensional scene of the sculpture and the ability control and preview the LEDs using code. Custom animations can then be submitted for approval as pull requests into the [main repo](https://github.com/squaredproject/Entwined). Since the sculpture is run nightly using LX Studio, submitted patterns have a good chance of being played.
