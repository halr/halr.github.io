***Work in Progress:*** For my final project art installation proposal, I'm thinking of a collection of mechanical flowers incorporating sensors, servers and LEDs. The catalyst for this project is the [Autumn Lights Festival](http://www.autumnlightsoakland.com) held outdoors at Oakland, California's Gardens at Lake Merritt.

## Inspiration
As the collection is intended to be displayed at the Autumn Lights Festival, we choose a themes of flowers, illumination, movement, and intangible interactivity. Many flowers are [heliotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliotropism). Daisies([bellis perennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellis_perennis)), for example, close their petals at night, open them in the morning light and then follow the sun as the day progresses.

## A Collection of Intangibly Interactive Flowers
All the flowers are of the family **Flora Machina**. The flowers in this family share a similar morphology: the flower heads are 3D printed in semitransparent filament; the glow is from small addressable LEDs rings or strips; the stamen are made from fiber optic strands; the petals are made from laser cut thin flexible plastic sheets and articulated with a servo pully system. The main differentiation is in the sensors.

### Genus and Species
All the flowers are of the genus **vesper** as they are all [vespertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespertine_%28biology%29) flowers, opening or blooming  in the evening. The individual species are:
* **vesper infrarudum** — is a small flower with a [PIR Motion Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13285) at its center, the petals open when movement is detected and the flower glows a soft orange.
* **vesper ultrasonus** — is a long stem playful flower, it will glow softly and open slowly when it's ultra sonic sensor detects something at the extreme of its range, but will start to close if it is approached. Its range of color is purple to red.
* **vesper lidarica** — similar to the above, but with a different sensor.
* **vesper videretropica** — The largest of the family is will turn to follow a subject. It has a low resolution camera hidden in the head of the flower.
