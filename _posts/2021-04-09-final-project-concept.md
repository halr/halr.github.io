For my MIxD final project, I am revisting the music interaction system of our [Conductive Melody](https://www.ampedatelier.com/conductive-melody) dress. Conductive Melody was created for the [Make Fashion 2019 runway show](http://www.makefashion.ca/makefashion-2019/). My desire to improve the dress, is partly why I enrolled in this class.

Here's my concept presentation for class.
