Who are experts in the area you're researching or making your project in? Is there anyone you wanted to talk to regarding your project/interest or their projects? Use this class as an opportunity to reach out to them with a reason. As the first step, identify at least two experts/mentors on your topic. They can be someone at ITP, NYU, or somewhere else. You'll reach out to them for a potential meeting in the next weeks.
