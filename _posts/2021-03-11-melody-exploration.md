**Pick a piece of music with an engaging melody and draw it.** *Engaging* is a very subjective term, but eleven year old me found the iconic five-note motif from the film [Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind#Music) to be very engaging.

The dialog in the film is very specific about the relation of the notes in the sequence.
> Give me a tone (Re to the second)\
Up a full tone (Mi to the third)\
Down a major third (Do to the first)\
Drop an octave (Do ...)\
Up a perfect fifth (So to the fifth)

In the traditional western musical notation, it's written thusly:

It is my understanding that the intervals: octave; fifth; major third; and whole tone; are the first audible intervals encountered in [harmonics partials](https://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q&A/Q35.html). Ground this with the diatonic scale, I came up with this:

Based on it, sketch an interactive melodic experience.
