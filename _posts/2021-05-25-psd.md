I'll be working on my thesis for Project Development Studio, which will take the form of a book presenting the current oeuvre of tech couture dresses by [Amped Atelier](https://www.ampedatelier.com).

### Dream Review
I used to say that we started Amped Atelier to get invited to the coolest parties. In fashion, there's no cooler party than the Met Gala! It's been described as the [Super Bowl of fashion](https://www.vogue.com/article/everything-we-know-about-met-gala-2021)! While I personally would not expect an invitation, the dream is that some well-heeled person would see our collection and choose to wear one to the ball! 


### Vision Statement
Here is the description to my ITP Camp session: [Tech Couture: Details Revealed](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2021/session/4). It's not perfect, but it's almost a vision statement.
> Take a look inside the Tech Couture dresses of Amped Atelier. The inspiration, construction, structure, sensors, power management as well as lessons learned will be revealed. Topics include LED diffusion, 3D printing on fabric, working with conductive fabric, wiring, and washability. You don't need to know about apparel construction, or how to read an electrical diagram, you just have to be interested in fashion and electronics.
