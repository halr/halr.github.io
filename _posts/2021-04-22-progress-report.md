***Work in Progress:*** I created a little inspirational video of Conductive Melody. I call it inspirational, because it is not a recored performance. At the event, due loss of connectivity, the reference model was not downloaded and the system failed. I created the audio track for the video as a mood piece, indicating the desired result.

I created a repeating sub bass line based on an example pattern from the [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/_img/565eeff1d24bc70300c8a69f_original.pdf). I then took the example pattern from the same source and  ran it through the Ableton Live Plugin [Magenta Studio](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/ableton-live)'s  [Continue](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/ableton-live#continue) tool for the number measures to get me a one minute piece.
