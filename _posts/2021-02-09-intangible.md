### What is intangible interaction?
Intangible Interactions are interaction that happen without any physical contact between the user and the system. I also would like to entertain that *intangible*, in the sense the something is difficult to define or understand, can also be a parallel aspect of intangible interaction. It is intriguing that user can sense that something is happening but not fully understand how or why.

### What is my favorite project that involves intangible interaction? 
I can't think of a favorite project that involves intangible interaction, but I probaly can't remember them. I have seen microsoft kinect projects that allow you play music. Projection mapping systems that sense where objects are placed and alter the environment. The instructor's [Invisible Sculptures](https://yeseul.com/Invisible-Sculptures-1-6) are very cool.

### Have you seen any projects that trick your senses with sensory illusions?
The old now long gone Star Trek Experience in Las Vegas had this neat transport effect. You were ushered into a room that was supposed to be a turbolift (a fancy star trek elevator), but then your space station is attacked, the room rocks a bit, lights flash, lots of battle sounds, a bit of smoke. Then, the lights go out you hear the familiar transportor sound, the light come up and your in a different room. It's bigger, the ceiling is higher, it's brighter, where the door was is now a wall, a different wall, to your right is a larger opening to the transporter room on the Enterprise. It was very convincing and well executed. There are behind the scenes videos of how they pulled it off.

### What is the relationship among intangible interaction, multi sensory experience and human perception?
I found the last essay in the [Sensorium](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sensorium) reading on *Synaesthesia* very interesting. The transport effect, I described above, is very *gesamtkunstwerk* in that most your senses were engaged in the production. Engaging multiple senses can help communicate action and provide another channel of feedback. A good example is the visual, auditory, and haptic feedback when typying on glass screen such as an phone or tablet. Lastly, I am interested in the association of color and music.
