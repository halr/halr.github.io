The [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube). One of the five [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid). A **curious cube** is one that people can interact with through intangible interaction. It a mystery box, it's form does not reveal it's function. Only by interacting with it can it's function be found.

I've been facinated by infinity cubes. If an infinity mirror is single dimensional, and infinity cude is three dimensional. At *rest*, the cube is simply a mirrored box, but when lit it's *infinite*.

They are [easy](https://www.instructables.com/Easy-Infinity-Cube/) to build. 

### The Inverted LED Tealight
A tealight could be mounted upside down in an infinity cube (it's infinitely reflective, who's to say what is up?). The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense could be mounted on the inverted base with a decorative cut out. *It lights up when the user blows thier warm breath on to it.* The LED could flicker when the cube detects hand gesture, and dim if something is in close proximity to the cut out.

### The mystery Box
Alternatively, the curious cube can be an opague mystery box. With a decorative cut out on the top for the sensors, it can react to proximity, gestures, light and sound. Actuators include decorative LEDs behind a defusing acrylic and a servo to rotate the top part of the cube from the top half. Sadly, this mystery box isn't an infinity cube.
