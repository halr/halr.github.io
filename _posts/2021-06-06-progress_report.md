We're one quarter through the summer session. The summer seems to be passing quickly. I started work on the InDesign file for the book. I updated the presentation that I will eventually present at ITP Camp. [ITP Camp](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2021/about) started this past Friday. Already there is interested in my [Tech Couture: Details Revealed](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2021/session/4) session, has evidenced by the number of RSVPs. The session will be presented over Zoom on Thursday, June 24 at 3pm.
