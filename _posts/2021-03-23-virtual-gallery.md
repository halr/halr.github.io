This week we individually made field trips to galleries, either real or virtual. I choose to visit the [Virtual Intangible Interaction Gallery 2021](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/intangible-interaction/virtual-intangible-interaction-gallery-2021/). 

Being a museum completist, I walked through all three exhibitions, but lingered more in the ones that caught my attention. I spent most time in *Invisibles* and in *Cloud Song* exhibitions. The show is wonderful and inspiring collection of works. 

My favorite work is [Quadrature](https://quadrature.co/about/)'s [Noise Signal Silence](https://quadrature.co/work/noise-signal-silence/). I love the scale of the piece, and the seemingly low tech nature of striking brass plates to produce sound. The collection of sound producing elements, the arms and brass plate devices, are beautifully sculptural to me. I love how live data is processed into signals for the sound producing arms.

If I were the artist, there is nothing I would have done differently. It's perfect, including the fact that the radio telescope dish is visible through the window where the main piece is shown. That said, I would love to hear what pulsars, the subject of their [LGM#1](https://quadrature.co/work/lgm1/) piece, would sound and look like when played on this piece.
